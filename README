Create new indexes.
Use this script to create new indexes on DS 6.x 7.x 
The default index type will be equality with default index-entry-limit:4000.
In the end, the script rebuilds each index separately.
You can add or remove indexes to be created by editting the script in section # settings
INDEXES=("cn" "mail" "ds-certificate-subject-dn" "ds-certificate-fingerprint" "uid")
Also you can change the type of index.
